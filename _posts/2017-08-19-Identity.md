DESCRIPTION:
Spam calls have been rapidly striking my phone recently. It's insane how far people are willing to go for a few bucks. How much time they're willing to waste to sit in a call center and call people who want nothing to do with them. As a security consultant, this got my thinking, what would happen if I tried tracking these numbers? Of course, it wouldn't go far because it's a VOIP and the point is to hide the identity of the client but what could I get?

TARGET:
In this scenario the target was "(302) 401-6618" and I was able to verify that this is, in fact, a VOIP number by performing a number of reverse carrier and number lookups.

For those who don't know a VOIP or Voice over Internet Protocol is a service that allows users to make phone calls over the internet. The point of using a VOIP is to secure the information of the person making the calls. This makes tracking the individual extremely difficult and next to impossible since no user identity is attached to these numbers.

After reviewing the number there was some interesting information that was found. First, this number is owned by a company named "Onvoy" who is now known as "Inteliquent". This company specializes in communications and has been around since 97'. Unfortunately, Inteliquent only allows law enforcement to obtain client information via phone numbers. However, It appears that someone has been using this number rapidly in the past month to deceive individuals into making donations to a Delaware Breast Cancer drive. Of course, all donations would be paid over the phone and this money would not actually go to the Delaware Breast Cancer drive but that is the apparent scam that this individual is using. When calling the number back on 05/30/2017 the number directs to a dial tone meaning the number is no longer in service. Although this number is no longer being used it is possible that the individual is now using a new number to conduct the same scam. This will typically happen for a number of reasons, in this instance the number (302) 401-6618 has been flagged worldwide as a spam number. So it is possible the individual is using a new number because their previous one is no longer clean.

VOIP's have always been known to be used in this manner. I'm sure everyone at some point has received a cold call from someone who is trying to sell a service or claiming that you have won something when you have never been associated with that program and don't know anyone from the state that they're calling from. This is just the way some people conduct business. Fortunately for us, there are a few methods to avoid these cold callers.

PREVENTION:
The first tool is called "Mr. Number Block" this tool has been around for a while and there are a million others just like it on both Android and iPhone. It's an app that not only acts as a caller ID but will also immediately block all spam or telemarketer phone calls. If a telemarketer attempts to call your number, it will immediately hang up before reaching your phone. Another tool to use can be found here http://www.inteliquent.com/contact-us/report-abuse  since Inteliquent will not disclose client information to the public. They have allowed individuals to report numbers in case of harassment or abuse. Finally, there is something called the National Do Not Call Registry found here https://www.donotcall.gov/ where you can report numbers and even add your number to a registry to help mitigate spam calls. This registry is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and has been created specifically for this reason, more information can be found here https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0108-national-do-not-call-registry#unwanted.

I receive spam calls every day, I never answer or care about them. Even in this scenario, there was no negative effect on me. It was curiosity that made me waste 30 minutes to research the number and even though I knew the outcome it was still something that sparked my interest just like many things in the realm of security. The point is however when it comes to these times of calls the simple solution is to not answer. Of course, you may answer because the call may be local to your location but if it doesn't apply let it fly. The more information you give these scammers the stronger they become. It doesn't matter if it's your name, email, whatever. The more you give them the longer they are able to conduct these attacks because the next thing they will move to if they only get a little bit of information from you is they will try to scam you through email. So next time you receive a spam call or email just keep in mind. "If it doesn't apply let it fly"
