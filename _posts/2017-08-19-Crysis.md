Crysis ransomware master keys have officially been posted to Pastebin. If you haven’t already deleted files that crooks encrypted with the Crysis ransomware, you’re in luck. These keys can also be used to decrypt files encrypted with .wallet and .onion extensions.

A member of BleepingComputer.com forums named lightsentinelone has posted a Pastebin link that leads to a C header file with 198 decryption keys. According to BleepingComputer, the keys have been confirmed as valid. Security researchers have already used these keys to create a Wallet Ransomware decryptor.


This isn’t the first time we’ve seen ransomware keys released. A year ago, the TeslaCrypt ransomware gang did the same thing.

There aren't too many reasons as to why someone would want to do this. After all the hard work of infecting these machines why throw in the towel now? Maybe because these crooks are actually sorry? or hacked by someone else and these keys were released against the owners will. Possibly the crook made off with a nice sum of cash and decided that enough was enough. Whatever the reason the fact that people can now decrypt their files is fantastic. Now let's get Wannacry on board with these trend!

Researchers at security firm ESET say that this is the third Crysis key release we’ve seen. ZDNet quoted them:

This has become a habit of the Crysis operators lately—with this being the third time keys were released in this manner. Since the last set of decryption keys was published, Crysis ransomware attacks have been detected by our systems over ten thousand times.

ESET has taken the latest Crysis keys and created a decryption tool that you can download here.
