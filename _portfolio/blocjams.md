## Explanation

BlocJams is a Music Playing Web Application that is designed to function like Spotify. BlocJams was designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. BlocJams is designed to be user friendly, fun, and feel vibrant for a more appealing use. Users are able to browse albums in a collection page:

Play songs from an album page:

Notice there is a Play Bar at the bottom of the album page that tracks the time of the current song being played. This Play Bar also has a fully functional volume control where users can turn the music up or down, play previous songs, play next songs and play/pause the song:

## Conclusion

BlocJams is a well designed project. This projected provided me with advanced knowledge of using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS and JQuery. Just like many projects, they are never complete. BlocJams falls into that category, expect big changes to this Project.
